# Base
## Colemak-DH with some more edits on the right hand.
Instead of '/' on the pinky bottom row there is ';' which is used in Greek for accents of letters ά,έ,ί,ό,ή,ύ,ώ and shifted accents like ϊ etc.
Instead of ';' on the pinky top row there is ' ' '.
This base layout don't have home row mods, as it is build for speed and not accidental hits of modifiers while typing and switching languages even in the same sentence between Greek and English.

## Thumb clusters
### On tap
**Esc, Space, Shift next character | Enter, Backspace, Delete**
The neutral thumb positions are used for the most common keypresses like Space and Backspace.
The outer palm (fast/not accurate) positions are used for shift next, like capitalizing the first letter of a word in a rolling motion and for enter to be easy to create new lines.
The inner palm (slow/hard to reach) positions are used for less common keypresses or keypresses that I don't want to hit accidentally like escape and delete.
Strong influence from miryoku layout here, although I chose to switch Tab in the left outer palm thumb key with Shift Next character. 

### On hold
**Layers momentarily activations Bluetooth, Navigation, Numbers | Symbols, Mouse, Function**
Inspired by the logic of miryoku while the thumb of one hand activates a layer and the other hands has access to that layers main keypresses and combos.
A typical miryoku layout has Media, Nav, Mouse | Sym, Num, Fun. My setup, though, is a bit different switching Numbers and Mouse momentary triggers.
I found it weird to type numbers with my left hand so Num had to move to the left thumb cluster. But because it is commonly used it shouldn't go in the inner palm. So my selection was to go to the outer palm key in order to keep navigation in the neutral thumb position. This drive me to move Mouse trigger in the right hand neutral thumb position that made sense as I was used to "move" in games in an inverted T manner with my left hand.

### Combos two keys
Having a choc and flat keycap allows for single finger multi key press.

Single middle left hand finger combo F, S gives me access to a single digit from the num layer and returns to base.
Single middle right hand finger combo U, E gives me access to a single digit from the sym layer and returns to base.
Note here that both the sticky and the momentarily switch triggers to nav and sym layers are consistent to the side from which they are triggered.

Having switched Tab in the left outer palm thumb key with Shift Next character I was in need of a quick Tab keypress. This is hosted under single right index finger two key combo on L, N.
Being in need of typing between Greek and English even in the same sentence and the windows shortcut for language switch being win+space or alt+shift I hosted this under a single left index finger two key combo on P, T.

### Combos three keys (layer toggles)
I needed some less straining option for toggling the layers of mouse and navigation where I would be probably spend a lot of time while browsing pages and documents or navigation file folders.
So a three key - three finger combor for each layer was created with the dominant fingers involved in their neutral position.
Note here that the layer toggle triggers exists in the part of the keyboard where the mouse and navigation options live, to provide a single handed use if needed in case I am using a mouse while navigating or holding my coffee while mouse-emulate browsing.
